This repository contains the nesseary code for the calculation preformed in project 2.

The code is contained within one file and one program which, takes inputs in order: filename of output, number of integratonpoints and spesificaton of matrix setup.

the 3rd input takes an integer 0,1 or 2. If 0 is provided the matrix is set up as a regular Toepliz marix,
if the 1 is provided the harmonic oscilator potential x^2 is added to the diagonal elements,
if 2 is provided the harmonic oscilator potential and the coulomb repultion \omega_r^2x^2+1/x is added to the diagonal.
